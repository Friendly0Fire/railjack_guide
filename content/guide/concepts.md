## The Basics

{{<imgdesc align="left" image="images/Tenno_Ship_2.jpg" title="Getting Started">}}
The first order of business is: how to get a Railjack. Before we begin, ensure that:
- You have completed the [Second Dream](https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/The_Second_Dream) quest.
- You are a member of a clan.
- Your clan has a completed Dry Dock room.

**Note: While you will be unable to play solo or host, you can still join others at any time!**

Once you have met the prerequisites, begin the [Rising Tide](https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Rising_Tide) quest from the central console in the Dry Dock.

{{<imgdesc align="right" image="images/Carbides.png" title="Resource Acquisition" imgwidth="4">}}
As part of the *Rising Tide* quest, you will need to collect some new Railjack resources. There are two possible approaches to obtaining these.

The first way is to look for them in regular missions:
- Carbides primarily drop on Ceres. Focus on elite enemies. *Kiste* is a good location.
- Pustrels exclusively drop from red ore veins on the *Plains of Eidolon*.
- Cubic Diodes primarily drop on Europa. Focus on elite enemies. *Larzac* is a good location.
- Copernics exclusively drop from red ore veins in the *Orb Vallis*.

The second, and much faster way, is to join Railjack crews. These resources are plentiful drops in any Empyrean mission.

{{<section>}}Intrinsics{{</section>}}

Intrinsics are unique in Warframe in that they are account-wide progression which improves your abilities aboard the Railjack as well as when flying your Archwing. Intrinsics are collected by simply gaining Affinity during Empyrean missions, at a rate of **20,000 Affinity per Intrinsic Point**. You are also capped in how many Intrinsic Points you can have, up to however many are required to completely max out all categories.

Intrinsics are currently split in **four** categories: Tactical, Piloting, Gunnery, Engineering. Command is expected to be released at a later date. All categories share some properties:

- The first few ranks tend to unlock new features.
- Rank 7 is a general Archwing buff. **This applies even outside of Railjack missions.**

If you wish to share your Intrinsics ranks, it is generally accepted to simply string the numbers in the order they appear above (TPGE), e.g. `8976` or `8.10.7.3`.

{{<imgdesc align="left" image="images/TacticalIntrinsic.png" title="Tactical Intrinsic" imgwidth="3" padding="1em">}}
Tactical Intrinsics focus on giving you additional options aboard a Railjack. This category should be among your top priorities due to the variety of features it unlocks.

| Rank | Name                    | Cost | Rating | Description                                                                                                                    |
|------|-------------------------|------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|    1 | Tactical System         |    1 |    5/5 | Allows the use of the Tactical Menu and deploying Tactical Avionics. Crucial to functioning on a Railjack.                     |
|    2 | Ability Kinesis         |    2 |    2/5 | Allows remotely deploying a Warframe ability for a Flux cost instead of energy. Situationally useful.                          |
|    3 | Command Link            |    4 |    4/5 | Allows fast travel between key locations within the Railjack. Very important when running with a small crew.                   |
|    4 | Recall Warp             |    8 |    4/5 | Allows fast travel back to the Railjack from anywhere else. Very important if doing side missions or using your Archwing.      |
|    5 | Overseer                |   16 |    1/5 | Allows remotely deploying Warframe abilities outside the ship by following other crew members. Niche uses.                     |
|    6 | Tactical Efficiency     |   32 |    2/5 | Reduces the cost of Ability Kinesis and Tactical Avionics by **25%**. Useful if Flux is low.                                   |
|    7 | Tactical Response       |   64 |    4/5 | Reduces Tactical Avionics cooldown by **25%**. Very useful for most Avionics.                                                  |
|    8 | Archwing Tactical Blink |  128 |    3/5 | Reduces Blink cooldown by **25%** in Archwing. Useful in large maps such as the Plains, Orb Vallis, or many Archwing tilesets. |
|    9 | Swift Tactics           |  256 |    3/5 | Reduces Tactical Avionics cooldown by **20%**. Very useful for most Avionics.                                                  |
|   10 | Join Warp               |  512 |    4/5 | Allows fast travel to any other crew member. Very useful to support other players.                                             |

{{<imgdesc align="left" image="images/PilotingIntrinsic.png" title="Piloting Intrinsic" imgwidth="3" padding="1em">}}
Piloting Intrinsics focus on improving your ability to pilot a Railjack. It is largely useless until you start actually flying, so you may want to delay getting ranks here.

{{<collapse id="intrinsics-tactical-collapse">}}
{{<table class="intrinsics-table table-striped">}}
| Rank | Name               | Cost | Rating | Description                                                                                                                                               |
|------|--------------------|------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|    1 | Boost              |    1 |    5/5 | Allows boosting by holding Shift. Absolutely essential to get around.                                                                                     |
|    2 | Vector Maneuver    |    2 |    5/5 | More boosting, this time by tapping Shift. You know the drill, it's good.                                                                                 |
|    3 | Vectored Evasion   |    4 |    1/5 | Enemy projectiles lose tracking when using Vector Maneuver. With a good build, projectiles are a non-issue, so this is largely useless.                   |
|    4 | Safe Flight        |    8 |    1/5 | Reduces collision damage by **50%**. Collision damage is already minimal and pretty rare, so mostly useless.                                              |
|    5 | Drift Maneuver     |   16 |    5/5 | More boosting, this time by "drifting" after a Vector Maneuver by holding Shift. Very fast, very fun, bit hard to master.                                 |
|    6 | Slipstream         |   32 |    5/5 | Increases boost time by **25%**. Same deal, more speed is better.                                                                                         |
|    7 | Enhanced Maneuvers |   64 |    5/5 | Vector and Drift Maneuvers consume **25%** less boost. Repeating ourselves, eh?                                                                           |
|    8 | Aeronaut           |  128 |    2/5 | Increases Archwing speed by **20%**. Good, but not very noticeable.                                                                                       |
|    9 | Evasion            |  256 |    1/5 | Reduces incoming damage by **10%** while boosting. Basically unnoticeable.                                                                                |
|   10 | Ramming Speed      |  512 |    1/5 | Hitting enemies while boosting deals **2000** Particle damage. Collisions are unreliable, this deals low damage, and your boost is too precious for that. |

{{<imgdesc align="left" image="images/GunneryIntrinsic.png" title="Gunnery Intrinsic" imgwidth="3" padding="1em">}}
Gunnery Intrinsics focus on improving your ability to shoot at things. Unfortunately, gun turrets are a very slow way to kill things, so this has limited use beyond rank 5.

{{<collapse id="intrinsics-gunnery-collapse">}}
{{<table class="intrinsics-table table-striped">}}
| Rank | Name               | Cost | Rating | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|------|--------------------|------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|    1 | Target Sync        |    1 | 4/5    | Shows lead indicators on targets (for turrets with travel time) and allows projectile lock-on. Important.                                                                                                                              |
|    2 | Phantom Eye        |    2 | 5/5    | Hides the ship entirely from view while on a side turret, allowing to aim and shoot at anything anywhere. Very good.                                                                                                                   |
|    3 | Archwing Slingshot |    4 | 2/5    | Enables using the Archwing Slingshot, which allows you to be shot like a projectile in your Archwing. Aiming is awkward, damage is minimal, range at **1850 meters** is very low. Mostly good to quickly close in on a distant target. |
|    4 | Archwing Warhead   |    8 | 2/5    | Slingshotting into a Crewship throws you into it directly, provided it does not have shields. Marginally useful.                                                                                                                       |
|    5 | Artillery Command  |   16 | 5/5    | Unlocks the Tunguska Cannon, which is the only Railjack weapon capable of destroying a Crewship. Essential.                                                                                                                            |
|    6 | Cold Trigger       |   32 | 2/5    | Reduces turret heat buildup by **20%**. Mediocre.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|    7 | Advanced Gunnery   |   64 | 2/5    | Reduces overheat cooldown by **50%** and extends Archwing Slingshot range to **2775 meters**. Mediocre as well.                                                                                                                        |
|    8 | Vengeful Archwing  |  128 | 3/5    | Increases a bevy of Archwing stats: damage **+25%**, ability strength **+20%**, ability range **+20%**, ability efficiency **+20%**. Get if you like Archwing.                                                                         |
|    9 | Combat Drift       |  256 | 2/5    | Drifting reduces heat buildup by **50%** and increases weapon damage by **50%**. Good, but drifting makes it very hard to aim at anything.                                                                                             |
|   10 | Reflex Aim         |  512 | 1/5    | Automatically snap to closest target for **0.5 seconds** when aiming. Useless.                                                                                                                                                         |

{{<imgdesc align="left" image="images/EngineeringIntrinsic.png" title="Engineering Intrinsic" imgwidth="3" padding="1em">}}
Engineering Intrinsics focus on repairing the ship and using the Forge. By far the most practical category, especially if playing as a crew rather than captain.

{{<collapse id="intrinsics-engineering-collapse">}}
{{<table class="intrinsics-table table-striped">}}
| Rank | Name              | Cost | Rating | Description                                                                                                                                |
|------|-------------------|------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|    1 | Applied Omni      |    1 | 3/5    | Speeds up repairs using the Omni. Useful, but not critical.                                                                                |
|    2 | Flux Forge        |    2 | 5/5    | Allows forging Flux. Absolutely, utterly essential.                                                                                        |
|    3 | Ordnance Forge    |    4 | 5/5    | Allows forging Ordnance. Also essential.                                                                                                   |
|    4 | Optimization Pass |    8 | 5/5    | Increases forging yield by **25%**. Due to the limited number of Forge stations, this is a necessity.                                      |
|    5 | Dome Charge Forge |   16 | 5/5    | Allows forging Tunguska Cannon ammunition. The Tunguska Cannon is essential, therefore so is its ammo.                                     |
|    6 | Forge Accelerator |   32 | 5/5    | Speeds up forging by **25%**. Essential due to the same reason as Optimization Pass.                                                       |
|    7 | Full Optimization |   64 | 5/5    | Increases forging yield by **25%** again. **N.B.:** this increases Dome Charge forging from 1 to 2 per craft. Critical.                    |
|    8 | Vigilant Archwing |  128 | 3/5    | Increases Archwing health, shields and armor by **30%** each. Good if you use Archwing, but won't let you survive in Empyrean much anyway. |
|    9 | Surplus Yield     |  256 | 1/5    | Increases Refinement yields by **10%**. Laughable for such a high Intrinsic Points cost.                                                   |
|   10 | Anastasis         |  512 | 3/5    | Allows remotely repairing one hazard at a time using the Tactical Menu. Situationally useful, especially if running a small crew.          |

### Recommended Progression

Due to the slow nature of Intrinsic Points gain, it's generally a good idea to focus on certain key skills. A general pathway is the following:

1. Get Tactical to 4, Gunnery to 5 and Engineering to 5 in any order you wish. Try stopping on valuable ranks.
2. Get Engineering to 7.
3. Get Piloting to 7. From this point, you are capable of doing everything competently.
4. Get your choice of Tactical and/or Engineering to 10.
5. Get every category to at least 8 for the Archwing bonuses.

**N.B.:** Due to the eventual release of the Command Intrinsic category and the cap on Intrinsic Points, it can be advisable to avoid getting to Rank 10 on every category, since this will leave 1023 points free, allowing one to level up Command to Rank 10 with just one extra Intrinsic Point to get. Generally speaking, `10.9.9.10` is the best spread currently.
