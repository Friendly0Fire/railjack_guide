## The Basics

{{<imgdesc align="left" image="images/Tenno_Ship_2.jpg" title="Getting Started">}}
The first order of business is: how to get a Railjack. Before we begin, ensure that:
- You have completed the [Second Dream](https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/The_Second_Dream) quest.
- You are a member of a clan.
- Your clan has a completed Dry Dock room.

**Note: While you will be unable to play solo or host, you can still join others at any time!**

Once you have met the prerequisites, begin the [Rising Tide](https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Rising_Tide) quest from the central console in the Dry Dock.

As part of the *Rising Tide* quest, you will need to collect some new Railjack resources. There are two possible approaches to obtaining these.

The first way is to look for them in regular missions:
- Carbides primarily drop on Ceres. Focus on elite enemies. *Kiste* is a good location.
- Pustrels exclusively drop from red ore veins on the *Plains of Eidolon*.
- Cubic Diodes primarily drop on Europa. Focus on elite enemies. *Larzac* is a good location.
- Copernics exclusively drop from red ore veins in the *Orb Vallis*.

The second, and much faster way, is to join Railjack crews. These resources are plentiful drops in any Empyrean mission.
