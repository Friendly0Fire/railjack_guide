{{<imgdesc align="left" image="images/begin/Tenno_Ship_2.jpg" title="Getting a Railjack" imgwidth="7">}}
The first order of business is: how to get a Railjack. Before we begin, ensure that:
- You have completed the *{{<wlnk>}}Second Dream{{</wlnk>}}* quest.
- You are a member of a clan.
- Your clan has a completed {{<wlnk>}}Dry Dock{{</wlnk>}} room.

**Note: While you will be unable to play solo or host, you can still join others at any time!**

Once you have met the prerequisites, begin the *{{<wlnk>}}Rising Tide{{</wlnk>}}* quest from the central console in the {{<wlnk>}}Dry Dock{{</wlnk>}}.
{{</imgdesc>}}

{{<imgdesc align="right" image="images/begin/Carbides.png" title="Resource Acquisition" imgwidth="4">}}
As part of the *{{<wlnk>}}Rising Tide{{</wlnk>}}* quest, you will need to collect some new Railjack resources. There are two possible approaches to obtaining these.

The first way is to look for them in regular missions:
- {{<wlnk>}}Carbides{{</wlnk>}} primarily drop on {{<wlnk>}}Ceres{{</wlnk>}}. Focus on elite enemies. *Kiste* is a good location.
- {{<wlnk>}}Pustrels{{</wlnk>}} exclusively drop from red ore veins on the *{{<wlnk>}}Plains of Eidolon{{</wlnk>}}*.
- {{<wlnk>}}Cubic Diodes{{</wlnk>}} primarily drop on {{<wlnk>}}Europa{{</wlnk>}}. Focus on elite enemies. *Larzac* is a good location.
- {{<wlnk>}}Copernics{{</wlnk>}} exclusively drop from red ore veins in the *{{<wlnk>}}Orb Vallis{{</wlnk>}}*.

The second, and much faster way, is to join Railjack crews. These resources are plentiful drops in any Empyrean mission.
{{</imgdesc>}}

{{<section>}}Railjack 101{{</section>}}

So, you now have a Railjack or have decided to join one. The question now is: what do you do? Let's start with a tour of the ship proper.

## General Layout

{{<calloutable image="images/begin/map.png">}}
{{<callout clip="645 80 120 150" title="Cockpit" titlealign="center" titlevalign="bottom">}}
This is the cockpit area, which houses the primary roles for the Railjack: the Pilot, the Tunguska Cannon Gunner and Navigation.
{{</callout>}}
{{<callout clip="545 30 100 250" title="Midsection" titlealign="center" titlevalign="bottom">}}
This is the midsection, which houses the two Side Gunner seats as well as the onboard Arsenal and the closest frontal exit.
{{</callout>}}
{{<callout clip="300 20 245 270" title="Spine" titlealign="center" titlevalign="bottom">}}
This is the spine, the largest section of the ship, which houses the Archwing Slingshot as well as more exits. It is where most boarders will spawn.
{{</callout>}}
{{<callout clip="15 80 285 155" title="Engineering" titlealign="center" titlevalign="bottom">}}
This is engineering, which houses the Forge as well as one more exit. This zone becomes more and more important as mission length and difficulty increases.
{{</callout>}}
{{</calloutable>}}

## The Cockpit

{{<calloutable image="images/begin/cockpit.png">}}
{{<callout clip="25 200 400 600" title="Tunguska Cannon">}}
This is the entrance to the *Tunguska Cannon* seat, also known as the Forward Artillery or, less formally, the BFG. It is the most formidable weapon aboard the Railjack, requiring specific unlocks to use and having the ability to destroy any enemy ship in the game, often in a single shot.
{{</callout>}}
{{<callout clip="425 500 450 400" title="Navigation" titlealign="right">}}
This is the *navigation console*. It is where new missions may be queued after the current mission has been completed.

**Beware:** there is *no* voting system and no confirmation prompt when selecting a new mission. If you are not the host and have not confirmed with the rest of the crew what your destination is, **please refrain from using this console!**
{{</callout>}}
{{<callout clip="1500 600 1060 700" title="Pilot" titlealign="right">}}
This is the *pilot's seat*. It is where the ship is maneuvered, the primary weapons fired, and the secondary weapons and battle avionics used. It is the most critical position on a Railjack, and one which requires a certain amount of familiarity. You will want to gain experience piloting a Railjack, but early on you should leave this role to a more experienced player if you wish to expedite the process of grinding materials.

**Note:** due to Warframe's peer-to-peer networking, it is *highly* recommended that only the host pilot the Railjack. Certain elements become much trickier when piloting as a client.
{{</callout>}}
{{</calloutable>}}

## The Midsection

{{<calloutable image="images/begin/midsection.png">}}
{{<callout clip="50 300 650 650" title="Exit" titlealign="right">}}
One of the many exits of the Railjack. While in mission, this will drop you in your Archwing next to the ship. When docked at the Dry Dock, this will teleport you to the consoles in the Dry Dock. All exits aboard the Railjack look the same, making them easy to spot from afar.
{{</callout>}}
{{<callout clip="900 500 550 250" title="Side Turret">}}
This is one of the Side Turrets aboard the Railjack. They have similar access to weaponry as the Pilot, but can be aimed independently. There is another turret not visible here on the other side of the ship.
{{</callout>}}
{{<callout clip="2050 350 400 500" title="Arsenal">}}
This is the onboard Arsenal of the Railjack. It is unfortunately only usable while in the Dry Dock, and will often move you to the Observatory Arsenal, making it of limited use.
{{</callout>}}
{{</calloutable>}}

## The Spine

{{<calloutable image="images/begin/spine.png">}}
{{<callout clip="1600 400 300 300" title="Archwing Slingshot" titlealign="right">}}
This is the entrance to the Archwing Slingshot, which allows you to propel your Archwing farther by literally shooting yourself out of a cannon. With more unlocks, you can eventually pierce the hull of certain ships to board them instantly.
{{</callout>}}
{{</calloutable>}}

## Engineering

{{<calloutable image="images/begin/engineering.png">}}
{{<callout clip="500 400 1600 500" title="Forge" titlevalign="bottom">}}
The Forge is composed of four individual terminals (two on each side) which can be used to craft ammunition and other such consumables during the mission.
{{</callout>}}
{{</calloutable>}}

{{<section>}}Mission Selection{{</section>}}

{{<imgdesc align="right" image="images/begin/navigation.png" title="Navigation" imgwidth="8">}}
Selecting a mission in Railjack is very similar to normal Warframe, with two crucial differences: there is **no vote** and **no countdown**. As such, it is generally recommended to let the host select the next mission and to validate with the crew that everyone is ready to go (e.g. a common approach is to type something to the effect of "r when ready" in the game chat, to which people will reply with "r" when ready).

While not explicitly shown, nodes in the "Proxima" regions are still unlocked sequentially, usually along some form of cycle, with progressively higher enemy levels. Here, in Earth Proxima, the first available mission is *Posit Cluster* and further missions are unlocked clockwise.
{{</imgdesc>}}

## Basic mission information

All Railjack missions share the same type: Skirmish. These involve destroying a randomized number of fighters, a fixed number of Crewships, and potentially some side-missions involving boarding a station. What Crewships are will be covered later in this guide.

Generally speaking, missions are distributed around so-called "breakpoints" which involve a step up in mission objectives. As such, it's generally advisable to take the lowest level mission of the given step you're looking for. For Earth Proxima, these are:
- When starting off and learning the ropes, you may want to try *Posit Cluster*. This is the easiest mission in the game. Be aware however that you are likely to be matchmade with similarly new players, which make prove to be a struggle. This location is ideal for Titanium farming by simply looting all scenery objects (asteroids and such) after the mission is done.
- *Jex Lanes* is the next breakpoint, involving 4 Crewships and more fighters as well as one potential side-mission.
- For special rewards, *Korms Belt* may spawn a Galleon Assassinate side-mission.

For Saturn Proxima, these are:
- *Lupal Pass* for the easiest mission in Saturn.
- *Vand Cluster* for the next breakpoint at 6 Crewships and more fighters, but still only one side-mission.
- *Kasio's Rest* for a **guaranteed** Galleon Assassinate in addition to a regular side-mission.

Veil Proxima is locked behind a progression system and will thus be covered later in this guide.

{{<section>}}Hazards{{</section>}}

While running your first few missions, you may have encountered *Hazards*. Much like {{<wlnk>}}Environmental Hazards{{</wlnk>}} in the rest of the game, some of these will cause various debuffs to your Warframe if you get close, but they additionally directly affect the Railjack so long as they are not repaired. There are currently five main Hazards in the game:
- **Fires**, constantly damaging the Railjack's health
- **Electrical Faults**, reducing the Railjack's shield capacity by **10%**
- **Ice Faults**, blocking a doorway until repaired
- **Hull Ruptures**, reducing the Railjack's maximum health by **5%**
- **Hull Breaches**, causing a mission failure if not patched within the allotted time

Note that only *one* Hazard of each type may be active at once. In addition, repairing some of these Hazards will also repair the ship:
- **Fires** repair by **15%**
- **Electrical Faults** repair by **15%**
- **Hull Ruptures** repair by **20%**
- **Hull Breaches** repair by **30%** and grant temporary invulnerability to the Railjack

Finally, Hazards use a consumable known as *Revolite*, which will be covered later. Regular Hazards consume **25 Revolite**, while Hull Breaches consume **100 Revolite**. If Revolite stocks are insufficient, the Hazard *cannot be fixed.*


### Repairing a hazard

Handling Hazards is a simple process. First, select the Omni Tool from your Gear Wheel (or use the dedicated hotkey for it). Then, simply walk up to the hazard to begin repairs.

#### Hull Rupture repair
Hull Ruptures and Hull Breaches both require you to essentially paint over the full breach with your cursor to patch it up.
{{<video static="images/begin/rupture.png" webm="videos/begin/Rupture Sequence.webm">}}

#### Other Hazards repair
All other hazards (fires, electrical and ice faults) instead work similarly to the mining minigame, requiring you to hold the left mouse button until the bar is within the highlighted region. Note that the bar has a soft edge, making it a little tricky to perfectly place in narrow regions.
{{<video static="images/begin/fire.png" webm="videos/begin/Fire Sequence.webm">}}

#### Hull Breaches

While Hull Breaches work similarly to Hull Ruptures, they must be repaired within the **60 seconds** countdown, otherwise the mission fails automatically. When successfully repaired, they will provide the Railjack with temporary invulnerability (represented by a gray shield/health bar), the duration of which is dependent on the length of time for which the rupture was active.
{{<video static="images/begin/critical.png" webm="videos/begin/Critical Sequence.webm">}}

{{<section>}}Intrinsics{{</section>}}

*Intrinsics* are a brand new mechanic introduced with Empyrean. They are *intrinsically* tied to your Operator/account rather than any piece of gear or Warframe. The game currently has *four* Intrinsic categories, with 10 Ranks each: *Tactical*, *Piloting*, *Gunnery* and *Engineering*. For more details on Intrinsics, see the [Intrinsics reference](/reference/intrinsics) page.

![Intrinsics Screen](/images/begin/intrinsics.png)

{{<imgdesc align="left" image="images/IntrinsicPoint.png" title="Intrinsic Points" imgwidth="3">}}

Intrinsics gate your progression aboard your Railjack. They are collected merely by accumulating Affinity normally at a rate of **20,000 Affinity per Intrinsic Point**. Regular actions such as killing enemies give normal Affinity, but Railjack-specific actions such as destroying fighters or repairing Hazards also provide a hefty amount of Affinity and are therefore a good source of Intrinsic Points. Affinity sharing is also functional, covers all sources of affinity gain (including the aforementioned Hazards and fighter kills) and has no maximum range.

**N.B.** Railjack is an excellent way to rank up equipment!
{{</imgdesc>}}

Ranking up an Intrinsic category costs an exponentially increasing number of Points, from 1 to reach Rank 1 to 512 to reach Rank 10. As a result, choosing which Intrinsics to go for is an important decision. As a new player, you will want to choose Intrinsics which allow you to be useful to crews so that you may join them and accelerate your own progression.

##### Tactical

The Tactical category has some of the most important Ranks in the game. Rank 1 (Tactical System) is **critical** to functioning aboard a Railjack and should be your first pick, since it unlocks the Tactical Menu. Beyond this, you may wait until you have other abilities unlocked and try to reach Rank 4 (Recall Warp) within a reasonable time frame. At this Rank, you will be able to perform most common actions: deploy Tactical Avionics (see below for details), remotely cast certain Warframe abilities, fast travel between key locations on the Railjack, and warp back to the Railjack from any exterior location.

##### Piloting

Piloting is a highly conditional Tactical category. If you do not intend to pilot a Railjack, you can safely delay getting any level into this category until much later. If you do intend to pilot a Railjack, you must prioritize reaching Rank 2 (Vector Maneuver) as soon as possible, with a longer term goal of Rank 7 (Enhanced Maneuvers).

##### Gunnery

Gunnery has mostly situationally useful Intrinsics, with one exception. Ranks 1 (Target Sync) and 2 (Phantom Eye) are substantial improvements to your ability to use Side Turrets as well as the main guns if you pilot, and as such should be fairly early picks if you use them a lot. Otherwise, the key Intrinsic to get is at Rank 5 (Artillery Command), which unlocks the *Tunguska Cannon*. If you want to contribute to the crew is a simple and fun way, this is your choice. After all, who doesn't like shooting a big gun?

##### Engineering

Engineering is a core skill of any good Railjack crew, but may not be the most exciting role to most. If you find that the idea of being in the cargo hold crafting ammunition and ensuring that all levels remain high enough to keep the ship going, then this is your category. Unfortunately, this is also the most expensive category to level if you want to be useful, with the absolute minimum being Rank 5 (Dome Charge Forge) in order to be able to craft every consumable the ship needs. In addition, Ranks 6 (Forge Accelerator) and 7 (Full Optimization) are often seen as essential due to their significant buffs.

#### Optimal Paths

Here are sample optimal paths. These are not to be taken as rigid gospel, merely as guidelines. **IP** indicates the running total of Intrinsic Points required across all four categories (**T**actical, **P**iloting, **G**unnery and **E**ngineering).

{{<inlinecss>}}
.route-table {
    width: 100%;
    overflow-x: auto;
    margin-bottom: 1em;
}
.route-table table {
    margin: auto;
    border-collapse: separate;
    border-spacing: 2px;

    background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);
    border: 2px transparent solid;
}
{{</inlinecss>}}

##### General route

If you don't really know what you prefer, this is a good start. You will rapidly gain the ability to board enemy stations and Crewships, use the Tunguska Cannon, efficiently fire the Turrets, and craft basic consumables at the Forge in a pinch.

{{<table class="route-table table-striped simple-scrollbars">}}

{{</table>}}

##### Piloting route

If you intend on piloting early, this is a good track. You will note that this goes much deeper into the Piloting tree than anywhere else, and as such should only be used if you intend to focus on Piloting. If you are short on crew and need to multitask, use the next route instead.

{{<table class="route-table table-striped simple-scrollbars">}}

| E  |   |   |   | 1 |   |    |    |    | 2  | 3  |    |     |
{{</table>}}

##### Piloting multitask route

This is the most expensive, but also the most thorough, route. It essentially involves getting you good enough in most roles so that you could *technically* solo Railjack missions (though this may be hectic early on!). You will be able to use most features, including the *Tunguska Cannon*, allowing you to quickly hop from the Pilot seat to kill a Crewship before moving back on, as well as quick travel to the Forge for resupply.

{{<table class="route-table table-striped simple-scrollbars">}}
| IP | 1 | 2 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 8 | 12 | 14 | 18 | 20 | 24 | 32 | 48 | 56 | 72 | 76 | 84 | 100 | 132 | 196 |

{{</table>}}

##### Engineering route

This route is more or less dedicated to engineering and the Forge, with many frontloaded abilities. It then gradually spreads to other categories to give you additional flexibility, such as using the *Tunguska Cannon* in addition to the Forge, which is a common multitask approach.

{{<table class="route-table table-striped simple-scrollbars">}}

{{</table>}}

{{<section>}}Avionics{{</section>}}

Unlike Intrinsics, *Avionics*, despite the fancy name, are a very familiar concept: they are essentially {{<wlnk>}}Mods{{</wlnk>}} for the Railjack. There are three main categories of Avionics which cover different parts of the Railjack: **Battle Avionics**, **Integrated Avionics** and **Tactical Avionics**.

{{<calloutable image="images/begin/avionics.png">}}
{{<callout clip="100 980 750 350" title="Battle Avionics">}}
*Battle Avionics* are closest to Warframe abilities. They are activated by the pilot using the same keys as usually bound to your Abilities 1 through 3. Each slot supports specific Avionics, so there are constraints as to what loadouts you can build (certain Avionics cannot be used simultaneously). These are mostly offensive and affect enemies *outside* the ship.
{{</callout>}}
{{<callout clip="1700 100 775 900" title="Integrated Avionics">}}
*Integrated Avionics* resemble a mixture of Warframe and weapon modding. They generally focus on either tank (health, armor, shields), damage (+% critical chance, etc.) or utility (faster Archwings near the Railjack). All nine slots can be used for any Integrated Avionic, but as usual only one copy of a given Avionic may be used.
{{</callout>}}
{{<callout clip="1700 1000 775 325" title="Tactical Avionics">}}
*Tactical Avionics* are utility abilities. They can be activated by anyone through the Tactical Menu and usually tend to provide crowd control against enemies on foot, assistance to the crew, or general Railjack utility.
{{</callout>}}
{{<callout clip="1050 50 450 300" title="Avionics Capacity">}}
Railjacks also have a Capacity, much the same way frames do. However, unlike other equipment, Orokin Catalysts/Reactors do not exist. Instead, a Railjack provides a fixed amount of capacity, which can be improved with a better Reactor (which will be covered later).
{{</callout>}}
{{</calloutable>}}

Of particular note is the notion of **Grid**. While the closest analog to the rest of the game would be a Polarization, the effect and mechanic are very different. The "Grid" is the sum total of all of your Avionics slots, and each of these slots can be improved individually three times. Each upgrade costs most and effectively increases the rank of the Avionic slotted into it, *even if that would overflow past the Avionic's max rank*. As a simple example, in the image above, the Avionic *Artillery Cheap Shot* has a single rank in and of itself, but is improved to rank 4 thanks to the Grid slot upgrade.

{{<imgdesc align="right" image="images/Dirac.png" title="Dirac" imgwidth="3" minheight="275px">}}
*Dirac* is the equivalent of {{<wlnk>}}Endo{{</wlnk>}} for Mods, upgrading their stats at the cost of progressively larger amounts of Dirac. It is also used to upgrade the aforementioned Grid.

**N.B.** In the current state of the game, Dirac is plentiful, coming from dismantling equipment, drops, and mission rewards. Feel free to spend it liberally.
{{</imgdesc>}}

### Core Avionics

As with Warframes and weapons, there are what one might consider "essential" mods. These are mods which substantially increase your survivability or power level. This section presents early Avionics to look for as well as where to look for them (the best location and enemy are **bolded**). Note that as of the current version, *all* Avionics drop exclusively from fighter enemies.

**N.B** If you join our Discord server, you will find that many core Avionics are plentiful, especially for veterans, and that you might be able to snatch a few of them for free!

{{<imgdesc align="left" image="images/begin/Bulkhead.png" title="Bulkhead" imgwidth="2" minheight="175px">}}
{{<wlnk>}}Bulkhead{{</wlnk>}} is the Railjack's {{<wlnk>}}Vitality{{</wlnk>}}, increasing Health by up to **+506%** at max rank. It is a fairly common Avionic. Note that you start with a Sigma-variant Bulkhead with much lower stats (the equivalent of {{<wlnk>}}Flawed Mods{{</wlnk>}}). This is one of the first priorities, especially when starting out, since it *massively* improves your Railjack's survivability.
* Locations: **Earth Proxima**, Saturn Proxima
* Enemies: **Elite Kosma Taktis (3.32%)**, Elite Gyre Taktis (3.32%)
{{</imgdesc>}}

{{<imgdesc align="right" image="images/begin/HullWeave.png" title="Hull Weave" imgwidth="2" minheight="175px">}}
{{<wlnk>}}Hull Weave{{</wlnk>}} is the Railjack's {{<wlnk>}}Steel Fiber{{</wlnk>}}, increasing Armor by up to **+253%** at max rank. It is a fairly common Avionic. Note that you start with a Sigma-variant Hull Weave with much lower stats (the equivalent of {{<wlnk>}}Flawed Mods{{</wlnk>}}). Similarly to Bulkhead, this is a massive boost to survivability and should be equipped as a priority.
* Locations: **Earth Proxima**, Saturn Proxima, Veil Proxima
* Enemies: **Kosma Taktis (3.32%)**, Gyre Taktis (3.32%), Exo Taktis (3.32%), Cannon Battery (3.32%)
{{</imgdesc>}}

{{<imgdesc align="left" image="images/begin/PolarCoil.png" title="Polar Coil" imgwidth="2" minheight="175px">}}
{{<wlnk>}}Polar Coil{{</wlnk>}} increases Turret Heat Capacity by up to **+66%** at max rank, allowing continuous fire for extended periods. It is a common Avionic. This Avionic's utility decreases as one gets familiar with Railjack combat and acquires Battle Avionics, but early on it is a very useful Avionic to speed up mission grinding.
* Locations: **Earth Proxima**, Saturn Proxima, Veil Proxima
* Enemies: **Kosma Cutter (5.7%)**, Elite Gyre Taktis (3.8%), Elite Gyre Cutter (3.3%), Exo Taktis (3.8%)
{{</imgdesc>}}

{{<imgdesc align="right" image="images/begin/ArtilleryCheapShot.png" title="Artillery Cheap Shot" imgwidth="2" minheight="175px">}}
{{<wlnk>}}Artillery Cheap Shot{{</wlnk>}} can give up to a **50%** chance of not consuming Dome Charges when firing the *Tunguska Cannon*, significantly reducing Forge pressure. It is an extremely common Avionic. This is a crucial Avionic at any level of play, since only 5 Dome Charges can be stockpiled at any given time.
* Locations: **Saturn Proxima**
* Enemies: **Gyre Cutter (7.3%)**, Gyre Outrider (3.8%)
{{</imgdesc>}}

{{<imgdesc align="left" image="images/begin/IntruderStasis.png" title="Intruder Stasis" imgwidth="2" minheight="175px">}}
{{<wlnk>}}Intruder Stasis{{</wlnk>}}, when activated, immediately freezes all enemies aboard the Railjack for up to **45 seconds** before cooling down for 240 seconds. It is a common Avionic. This is a useful Avionic early on to reduce stress and complexity, especially with a small crew, but can be safely dropped later on.
* Locations: Earth Proxima, **Saturn Proxima**
* Enemies: Elite Kosma Cutter (3.8%), **Elite Gyre Flak (14.6%)**
{{</imgdesc>}}

{{<wlnk>}}Battle Forge{{</wlnk>}}, when activated, reduces the remaining cooldown on *all* Forge consoles by up to **120 seconds**, essentially allowing their immediate use again, which also significantly reduces Forge pressure, before cooling down for 480 seconds. It is a common Avionic. This Avionic's utility increases over time, becoming more and more relevant as Battle Avionics start getting used, draining Flux faster. It is not as necessary early on.

{{<imgdesc align="left" image="images/begin/AnodeCell.png" title="Anode Cell" imgwidth="2" minheight="175px">}}
{{<wlnk>}}Anode Cell{{</wlnk>}} is the Railjack's {{<wlnk>}}Fast Deflection{{</wlnk>}}, increasing Shield Recharge by up to **+80%** at max rank. It is a rare Avionic. This is more useful than {{<wlnk>}}Maxima{{</wlnk>}}, the Railjack's equivalent of {{<wlnk>}}Redirection{{</wlnk>}}, since shields tend to get shredded very easily and frequently restoring then losing shields allows you to take full advantage of the Railjack's long shield gate to take no damage for 3 seconds each time.

{{<imgdesc align="right" image="images/begin/Hyperstrike.png" title="Hyperstrike" imgwidth="2" minheight="175px">}}
{{<wlnk>}}Hyperstrike{{</wlnk>}} is the Railjack's {{<wlnk>}}Serration{{</wlnk>}}, increasing Turret Damage by up to **+121%** at max rank. It is a rare Avionic. Note that you start with a Sigma-variant Hyperstrike with much lower stats (the equivalent of {{<wlnk>}}Flawed Mods{{</wlnk>}}). This is of similar utility than Polar Coil, but due to its rarity is ranked lower. It should be used *before* Polar Coil if one is lucky enough to get it early on, since it reduces time to kill substantially.

{{<section>}}Railjack Equipment{{</section>}}

As has been hinted prior in this guide, the Railjack has some fairly specialized equipment. First, let's cover the two interactable elements we haven't touched upon much yet: the **Forge** and the **Tunguska Cannon**.

## Forge

![Forge Screen](/images/begin/forge.png)

The Forge allows you to convert resources accumulated in the mission into usable consumables for the Railjack. These are, from left to right,
* **Revolite**, used to repair Railjack Hazards with the Omni.
* **Flux Energy** (usually simply called Flux), used to fuel Battle and Tactical Avionics.
* **Munitions** (sometimes called Ordnance), used to fire the Ordnance Launcher.
* **Dome Charges**, used to fire the Tunguska Cannon.

Note that each consumable has a maximum storage aboard the Railjack. Attempting to craft beyond this limit will *waste* any overflow. These limits can occasionally be modified with Avionics:
* **Revolite** has a maximum of 300 and cannot be increased; {{<wlnk>}}Revo Reducer{{</wlnk>}} can be used to reduce consumption.
* **Flux Energy** has a variable limit depending on your Reactor, and can also be further increased with {{<wlnk>}}Hyperflux{{</wlnk>}}; some Intrinsics also reduce consumption.
* **Munitions** have a variable limit depending on your Ordnance Launcher, and can also be boosted with {{<wlnk>}}Overloader{{</wlnk>}}.
* **Dome Charges** have a maximum of 5 and cannot be increased; {{<wlnk>}}Artillery Cheap Shot{{</wlnk>}} can be used to reduce consumption.

The four crafted consumables in turn depend on four drops: {{<wlnk>}}Carbides{{</wlnk>}}, {{<wlnk>}}Copernics{{</wlnk>}}, {{<wlnk>}}Cubic Diodes{{</wlnk>}} and {{<wlnk>}}Pustrels{{</wlnk>}}. These are all common drops in missions from enemies and destructible scenery. The Forge by default has a capacity of **200** of each of these drops, with extra resources being turned directly into mission rewards. This capacity can be increased with {{<wlnk>}}Deep Hold{{</wlnk>}}, but is of limited use.

After crafting a consumable, the Forge used enters cooldown for some time which depends on your Intrinsics. The challenge therefore becomes choosing which consumable to craft at which point in order to manage Forge cooldowns while keeping stocks high enough.

At the end of a sequence of missions, just before jumping into the Dry Dock, it is a good idea, especially early on, to use the *Refine* button. This turns remaining drops into mission rewards, multiplying them by a refinement factor which depends on your unlocked Intrinsics.

While the Forge is primarily an in-mission feature, it is also accessible from the Dry Dock. There, it can be used to instantly craft the maximum amount of each consumable instantly. Unlike within a mission, overshooting will preserve extra crafted consumables and make them available in the next mission. **Remember to always fill up your consumables after a mission so you never lack them to start one!**

## Tunguska Cannon

{{<video static="images/begin/tunguska.png" webm="videos/begin/Tunguska Sequence.webm">}}

The Tunguska Cannon is the ultimate weapon aboard a Railjack. It is the *only* weapon capable of taking down Crewships. Using it involves getting into the Cannon's control seat, which is housed below the cockpit deck, and then charging up the weapon. The weapon's charge can be cancelled without firing as long as it has not completely charged. If it has, it *will* fire when releasing the button, but can be held for a few seconds to aim.

The remaining charges available are shown in the bottom left corner of the HUD.

### Taking down Crewships

<!-- Insert Crewship handling video here -->

Crewships are the biggest threat aboard a Railjack, sporting heavy cannons and the ability to spawn {{<wlnk>}}Ramsleds{{</wlnk>}} which can impact your ship and allow boarders inside. They are also a systematic requirement to completing missions, making them often a priority.

Taking down Crewships with the Tunguska Cannon is a fairly straightforward experience: point and shoot. The devil, however, is in the details. The Crewship has **weak points** which must be exploited at higher levels to ensure a timely kill.

{{<calloutable image="images/begin/crewship.png">}}
{{<callout clip="0 0 100 100" title="Nacelle Weakpoint">}}
The nacelle is the most reliable weakpoint, spanning most of the length of a Crewship on either side. Hitting anywhere on this counts as a critical hit.
{{</callout>}}
{{<callout clip="0 0 100 100" title="Thruster Weakpoints">}}
The thrusters are the easiest weakpoint to see, but they are inconsistent. **A blown out (not glowing) thruster takes no damage!** If you see that the thruster you were aiming at is out, quickly retarget a new one or abort the charge. If you are on a Side Turret, *do not shoot thrusters unless told to!*

## Components

The Railjack also sports three customizable pieces of passive equipment: the **Engines**, the **Shield Array** and the **Reactor**. Each is available in four Houses (Sigma, Lavan, Vidar, Zetki) and three ranks (Mk I through III), with House Sigma being the "default" House with no performance improvements. You will be provided with basic Sigma components and can craft up to Sigma Mk III components through Dojo research, but these are generally poor value.

### Engines

The engine controls your base speed and your boost multiplier.
* House Lavan provides the weakest base speed but strongest boost multiplier.
* House Vidar provides the strongest base speed but weakest boost multiplier.
* House Zetki provides a balanced approach.

Since boost capacity is low, **Vidar** Engines are currently preferred.

### Shield Array

The shield array controls your shield capacity, shield regeneration, and shield regeneration *delay* (i.e. how long the shield needs to not take damage to start recharging).
* House Zetki provides the weakest capacity but strongest regeneration and shortest delay.
* House Lavan provides the strongest capacity but weakest regeneration and shortest delay.
* House Vidar provides a balanced approach.

Since shields tend to last a very short time in most circumstances, a reactive approach with a **Zetki** Shield Array is currently preferred.

### Reactor

The reactor controls your Avionics and Flux capacities.
* House Zetki provides the weakest Avionics capacity but strongest Flux capacity.
* House Vidar provides the strongest Avionics capacity but weakest Flux capacity.
* House Lavan provides a balanced approach.

Unlike other components, the Reactor is more of a matter of preference. Builds using few Avionics can sneak in with a Zetki Reactor for additional Flux capacity, while hungrier builds can use either of the other two according to their needs. Additional Flux capacity is also not necessarily a better call, since regenerating this Flux is no faster or easier even with more capacity.
