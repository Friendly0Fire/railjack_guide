{{<imgdesc align="left" image="images/begin/Tenno_Ship_2.jpg" title="Getting a Railjack">}}
The first order of business is: how to get a Railjack. Before we begin, ensure that:
- You have completed the *{{<wlnk>}}Second Dream{{</wlnk>}}* quest.
- You are a member of a clan.
- Your clan has a completed {{<wlnk>}}Dry Dock{{</wlnk>}} room.

**Note: While you will be unable to play solo or host, you can still join others at any time!**

Once you have met the prerequisites, begin the *{{<wlnk>}}Rising Tide{{</wlnk>}}* quest from the central console in the {{<wlnk>}}Dry Dock{{</wlnk>}}.

{{<imgdesc align="right" image="images/begin/Carbides.png" title="Resource Acquisition" imgwidth="4">}}
As part of the *{{<wlnk>}}Rising Tide{{</wlnk>}}* quest, you will need to collect some new Railjack resources. There are two possible approaches to obtaining these.

The first way is to look for them in regular missions:
- {{<wlnk>}}Carbides{{</wlnk>}} primarily drop on {{<wlnk>}}Ceres{{</wlnk>}}. Focus on elite enemies. *Kiste* is a good location.
- {{<wlnk>}}Pustrels{{</wlnk>}} exclusively drop from red ore veins on the *{{<wlnk>}}Plains of Eidolon{{</wlnk>}}*.
- {{<wlnk>}}Cubic Diodes{{</wlnk>}} primarily drop on {{<wlnk>}}Europa{{</wlnk>}}. Focus on elite enemies. *Larzac* is a good location.
- {{<wlnk>}}Copernics{{</wlnk>}} exclusively drop from red ore veins in the *{{<wlnk>}}Orb Vallis{{</wlnk>}}*.

The second, and much faster way, is to join Railjack crews. These resources are plentiful drops in any Empyrean mission.

So, you now have a Railjack or have decided to join one. The question now is: what do you do? Let's start with a tour of the ship proper.

## General Layout

{{<calloutable image="images/begin/map.png">}}
{{<callout clip="645 80 120 150" title="Cockpit" titlealign="center" titlevalign="bottom">}}
This is the cockpit area, which houses the primary roles for the Railjack: the Pilot, the Tunguska Cannon Gunner and Navigation.
{{</callout>}}
{{<callout clip="545 30 100 250" title="Midsection" titlealign="center" titlevalign="bottom">}}
This is the midsection, which houses the two Side Gunner seats as well as the onboard Arsenal and the closest frontal exit.
{{</callout>}}
{{<callout clip="300 20 245 270" title="Spine" titlealign="center" titlevalign="bottom">}}
This is the spine, the largest section of the ship, which houses the Archwing Slingshot as well as more exits. It is where most boarders will spawn.
{{</callout>}}
{{<callout clip="15 80 285 155" title="Engineering" titlealign="center" titlevalign="bottom">}}
This is engineering, which houses the Forge as well as one more exit. This zone becomes more and more important as mission length and difficulty increases.
{{</callout>}}
{{</calloutable>}}

## The Cockpit

{{<calloutable image="images/begin/cockpit.png">}}
{{<callout clip="400 400 550 500" title="Tunguska Cannon">}}
This is the entrance to the *Tunguska Cannon* seat, also known as the Forward Artillery or, less formally, the BFG. It is the most formidable weapon aboard the Railjack, requiring specific unlocks to use and having the ability to destroy any enemy ship in the game, often in a single shot.
{{</callout>}}
{{<callout clip="1200 500 325 325" title="Navigation" titlevalign="bottom">}}
This is the *navigation console*. It is where new missions may be queued after the current mission has been completed.

**Beware:** there is *no* voting system and no confirmation prompt when selecting a new mission. If you are not the host and have not confirmed with the rest of the crew what your destination is, **please refrain from using this console!**
{{</callout>}}
{{<callout clip="1700 400 550 350" title="Pilot" titlealign="right">}}
This is the *pilot's seat*. It is where the ship is maneuvered, the primary weapons fired, and the secondary weapons and battle avionics used. It is the most critical position on a Railjack, and one which requires a certain amount of familiarity. You will want to gain experience piloting a Railjack, but early on you should leave this role to a more experienced player if you wish to expedite the process of grinding materials.

**Note:** due to Warframe's peer-to-peer networking, it is *highly* recommended that only the host pilot the Railjack. Certain elements become much trickier when piloting as a client.
{{</callout>}}
{{</calloutable>}}

## The Midsection

{{<calloutable image="images/begin/midsection.png">}}
{{<callout clip="50 250 500 600" title="Arsenal">}}
This is the onboard Arsenal of the Railjack. It is unfortunately only usable while in the Dry Dock, and will often move you to the Observatory Arsenal, making it of limited use.
{{</callout>}}
{{<callout clip="1000 400 450 250" title="Side Turret">}}
This is one of the Side Turrets aboard the Railjack. They have similar access to weaponry as the Pilot, but can be aimed independently. There is another turret not visible here on the other side of the ship.
{{</callout>}}
{{<callout clip="1800 500 500 300" title="Exit" titlevalign="bottom">}}
One of the many exits of the Railjack. While in mission, this will drop you in your Archwing next to the ship. When docked at the Dry Dock, this will teleport you to the consoles in the Dry Dock.
{{</callout>}}
{{</calloutable>}}

## The Spine

{{<calloutable image="images/begin/spine.png">}}
{{<callout clip="1400 200 300 300" title="Archwing Slingshot" titlealign="right" titlevalign="bottom">}}
This is the entrance to the Archwing Slingshot, which allows you to propel your Archwing farther by literally shooting yourself out of a cannon. With more unlocks, you can eventually pierce the hull of certain ships to board them instantly.
