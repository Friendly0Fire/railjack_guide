The first order of business is: how to get a Railjack. Before we begin, ensure that:
- You have completed the *{{<wlnk>}}Second Dream{{</wlnk>}}* quest.
- You are a member of a clan.
- Your clan has a completed {{<wlnk>}}Dry Dock{{</wlnk>}} room.

**Note: While you will be unable to play solo or host, you can still join others at any time!**

Once you have met the prerequisites, begin the *{{<wlnk>}}Rising Tide{{</wlnk>}}* quest from the central console in the {{<wlnk>}}Dry Dock{{</wlnk>}}.

As part of the *{{<wlnk>}}Rising Tide{{</wlnk>}}* quest, you will need to collect some new Railjack resources. There are two possible approaches to obtaining these.

The first way is to look for them in regular missions:
- {{<wlnk>}}Carbides{{</wlnk>}} primarily drop on {{<wlnk>}}Ceres{{</wlnk>}}. Focus on elite enemies. *Kiste* is a good location.
- {{<wlnk>}}Pustrels{{</wlnk>}} exclusively drop from red ore veins on the *{{<wlnk>}}Plains of Eidolon{{</wlnk>}}*.
- {{<wlnk>}}Cubic Diodes{{</wlnk>}} primarily drop on {{<wlnk>}}Europa{{</wlnk>}}. Focus on elite enemies. *Larzac* is a good location.
- {{<wlnk>}}Copernics{{</wlnk>}} exclusively drop from red ore veins in the *{{<wlnk>}}Orb Vallis{{</wlnk>}}*.

The second, and much faster way, is to join Railjack crews. These resources are plentiful drops in any Empyrean mission.
